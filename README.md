# CS-230-Portfolio
# Course work and final design document for CS-230 Software Development.
# CS-230 Module Eight Journal Reflection
# Brief Summary
The client, The Gaming Room, requested a software application designed to manage teams, games, and players effectively. They needed an application capable of organizing gaming tournaments, managing team rosters, ensuring unique names for teams and games, and securely handling user authentication through a RESTful API.
# Strengths in Documentation
# In creating the software design document, I was particularly thorough in clearly outlining the application's functionality, design patterns, and UML diagrams. My emphasis on readability and structured organization helped ensure clarity for both the client and the development team.
# Helpful Aspects of Design Documentation
# Working through the design document proved instrumental during coding, as it provided a detailed roadmap to guide the implementation of classes, inheritance, and design patterns such as Singleton and Iterator. It clarified the projectâ€™s scope and reduced potential confusion during development.
# Area for Improvement
# If given an opportunity to revise one section of my documentation, I would focus on refining the API endpoints section. Specifically, I'd expand the details of response codes and error handling to provide greater clarity, which would improve usability and troubleshooting for future developers.
# Interpreting User Needs
# Understanding the client's needs involved translating their requirements into precise, implementable features. I closely analyzed their request for managing unique entities and secure authentication, integrating solutions such as the Singleton pattern for consistent game management and Basic Authentication for security. Considering user needs is critical because it ensures that the final product aligns closely with the client's practical requirements and user expectations, leading to a more effective and satisfactory application.
# Software Design Approach
# My approach to designing software began with analyzing and breaking down client requirements into clearly defined modules and classes. Utilizing UML diagrams and design patterns helped me conceptualize and structure the application effectively. For future projects, I would emphasize iterative development, continually revising and validating designs with stakeholder feedback to maintain alignment with user requirements and expectations.
